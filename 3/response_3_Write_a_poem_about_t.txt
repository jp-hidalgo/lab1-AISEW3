Prompt:
Write a poem about the beauty of nature. Then, continue the poem with a stanza about the changing seasons.

Response:
The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
On emerald hills and whispering trees,
Where birdsong weaves a melody,
And gentle breezes dance with ease.

A crystal stream, a silver thread,
Through meadows green, a winding way,
Where wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,
And butterflies on sunshine play.

The mountains rise, a towering grace,
Their granite peaks kissed by the sky,
A canvas painted, time and space,
Where clouds drift by in silent sigh.

**Then autumn comes, with hues of gold,
And crimson leaves that gently fall,
A whispered promise, story told,
Of winter's sleep, embracing all.**
